DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_01="Now that we've finally got this place up and running, we should be able to access some of these dormant alien systems.  Let's see if you two can play nice."
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_02="What the...?"
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_03="Shen, getting some kind of interference up here.  Seems to be hitting us across the board."
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_04="Working on it."
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_05="Something triggered your remote uplink...but how is that possible?  No one knows these systems."
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_06="Shen...power readings just spiked.  What the hell is going on down there?"
DLC3_TP_ShenMessage_07="Dad?"

DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_01="So this is it...what that thing has been ranting about."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_02="You've come this far.  All you have to do is link my systems for the transfer.  There is no need for further conflict."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_03="Shen...Tell me you're not actually listening to this thing."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_04="This was definitely Dad's design."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_05="Identity: SHEN, LILY.  Awaiting impression."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_06="No!  Impossible!  THIS CANNOT BE WHAT FATHER WANTED!"
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_07="Something tells me this is exactly what he wanted."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_08="Identity confirmed.  Initiating boot protocols."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_09="No! I will not allow you-"
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_10="It's...really him."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_11="Lily, if you are seeing this message, it means that you have successfully activated the SPARK prototype.  It also means that in all likelihood I am no longer with you. It was always among my greatest fears that I would leave you alone in this world.
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_12="You didn't."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_13="I had hoped this day would never come.  But since the loss of the Commander, the XCOM project has...suffered. Our latest reports indicate we cannot hold this base much longer."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_14="To that end, I have accelerated the development of the SPARK robotic prototype. I believe that someday this machine will prove pivotal to humanity's survival. Though the unit is not ready for manufacturing, this prototype has been coded for one specific task."
DLC3_TP_SparkActivation_15="It will protect you, perhaps better than I ever could. For of all I have seen and accomplished in this life Lily, there is one thing I know for sure, you are my greatest gift to this world."
