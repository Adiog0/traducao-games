[Play_Sea_Terror_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not sure who it was on the team that first pointed out that the Chryssalids seemed a little preoccupied with the DJ's makeshift antenna rig. Like I said before, we didn't know much about the motivations of the Chryssalid mind. I figured they just followed the lights. That's what bugs do."

[Play_Sea_Terror_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Chryssalids weren't too much an issue for us, but we were only slightly closer to figuring out just what the hell was going on."

[Play_Sea_Terror_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to survive, but the stronger these radio signals got, the more Chryssalids we seemed to run into. I was about ready to throw coincidence out the window."

[Play_Sea_Terror_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a tough fight. Some of my people got a little too close out there, but we eventually pulled through."

[Play_Sea_Terror_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took some casualties-the Chryssalids are never easy-but we managed to get out of there and keep moving. We had a mystery on our hands and I wasn't about to let it go."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="We actually came across one of the DJ's installations in that town. You wouldn't have guessed it was anything special from the looks of it, but it obviously worked. There were a few hints of alien technology, but nothing that seemed all that crazy. I should have known better."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ may have been off his rocker, but I had to give him a little credit, I mean the guy was out there building his own radio network. Half the time we could barely find recruits who knew how to turn on a radio."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't have a clue where he was broadcasting from at that point. For all we knew he could have been thousands of miles away. That was until he mentioned those \"big mean bugs\" he thought he saw. It was possible that these white Chryssalids were all over the world, but it seemed a lot more likely that the DJ was somewhere close by."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="On the far side of town someone had put together a makeshift workshop with a bunch of salvaged equipment in an old RV. The bigger cause for concern was the radio tower, this wasn't some half-assed project. Someone knew what they were doing, and that was the sort of thing that got ADVENT's attention real quick..."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="By now you might be asking yourself, Central, if you didn't want to listen to the DJ, why not just shut off your radio? And you'd be right to ask. You see, the problem was the stronger his signal got, the more it interfered with our commlink. We could either go completely radio silent, or put up with him for a bit longer."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="These kinds of settlements had been cropping up everywhere in the outlying territories once ADVENT established the new regional districts. People were running out of places to hide though, the aliens are nothing if not persistent."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Surprisingly enough it wasn't the Chryssalids this time, at least not right off the bat. ADVENT was in town, and they seemed to be having some trouble with the bugs too. We also had a few civilians to contend with. The whole situation was a mess."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we got close enough, ADVENT made themselves known. At the time, I think I was actually relieved that it wasn't another pack of Chryssalids."

[Play_Sea_Terror_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We pulled some gear from the workshop we found setup by the radio tower. There was some decent stuff in there, so the choice of what to haul out wasn't easy."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="If the Chryssalids were moving underwater, every town, camp, and settlement along the coast was at risk of the same fate as that last one. We decided to keep moving, if nothing else we could try and warn people before the next attack. And wouldn't you know it? The further we got, the stronger the signal from the new self-proclaimed \"King of the airwaves.\" Part of me was almost hoping ADVENT would drown him out with some soothing propaganda of their own, but he had really jammed up their frequencies somehow."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="There was a cold snap moving in, the wind coming off the water was brutal. I only remember because when we got to the camp...it was burning, and the heat was a welcome change despite knowing what it meant for the locals."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Let me walk you through it again."

[Play_Sea_Terror_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="There wouldn't be a story to tell if some of us hadn't at least survived the encounter, right?"

[Play_Sea_Terror_CiviliansWipe AkEvent]
SpokenText="I know for sure we rescued at least some of the civilians in that town. Let's try it again."

[Play_Sea_Terror_CiviliansSaved AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to save a few of the civilians before the Chryssalids got to 'em."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="So that's it, that's the whole story. The DJ made one helluva mess, but we managed to clean it up despite all the surprises he pulled on us. At the end of the day, we all came out better from it, but don't tell him I said that."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a good story, right? A happy ending for everyone, even the DJ who went on to a successful career with the resistance."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="And that's the story of how I first met the DJ, and how he became the future voice of the Resistance. I guess you could say we're sort of friends now, but it sure took me a while to warm up to him."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things got a little ugly, but in the end we pulled it off, and I'm here today to share the tale of our heroic victory."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We made some sacrifices along the way. Not everyone made it out in one piece, but who knows what kind of nightmare we prevented by shutting down the network before things went any further?"

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Outro AkEvent]
SpokenText="After things settled down, the DJ and I had a few drinks and made nice despite all the trouble he had given us. Shen actually ended up vouching for the guy, at least on the technical side. She was impressed with his makeshift network considering her own struggles dealing with the alien tech. So I guess in the end, he wasn't totally insane after all, just a little overly eager to chase his visions of grandeur."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_NagNoTurns AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were a little sharper than that. We had to be quick if we wanted to survive this one."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Nag3Turns AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were definitely starting to run short on time. We had to get in there and blow this thing up before we got overrun."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Nag1Turn AkEvent]
SpokenText="We're pushing our luck on the timetable here. We need to bring this story to a dramatic conclusion - fast."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="On that point, surprisingly enough, I agreed with him. After all the work we put in saving him, we might as well get something in return. Once he managed to pull it together a little bit, learned to work through official channels, he had a future in radio, and the resistance was actually better off for it."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="I wasn't really sure what was going to happen once we blew up the transmitter. We didn't have time to make much distance, so if anything crazy happened, we were gonna get caught right in the middle of it. Even expecting the worst, we were still bound to run into a few surprises."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="To be honest, I was focused on blowing up a piece of alien technology that might or might not end up exploding in my face. I really wasn't paying all that much attention to the radio at that point, but I'll admit - maybe I was a little harsh on the guy."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="The transmitter was out on a bluff reinforced with scrap and all sorts of junk the DJ had presumably thrown together. It almost looked like he had somehow moved the transmitter out to this position, but it was beyond me how he might have pulled that off. From what I had seen so far, nothing was impossible."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="We brought along some makeshift X4 charges to take down the transmitter, but the alien alloys were tough. I wasn't completely confident it was going to work, but I made sure not to mention that to the others. If it came down to it, I was willing to do whatever it took to put a stop to this."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="With the number of alien forces in the area, I started to wonder whether we were both after the same thing. For all I knew, the aliens had come here to shut down or destroy the transmitter themselves before they caught wind of us. We were never gonna find out, but we might have saved ourselves some trouble."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I decided to leave the DJ at his post in front of the radio in case there were any other surprises left waiting for us down there. I think he had finally gotten the message though. We weren't screwing around anymore, and none of us were laughing."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't just Chryssalids we ran into that day on the waterfront, I got the distinct impression the aliens were very unhappy with whatever modifications the DJ made to their transmitter. They sent just about everything in their arsenal out there from what I remember. Still wasn't enough for us."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="I had had just about enough of the DJ and his secrets. I was about ready to beat it out of him, but finally he came clean. I wasn't kidding before when I said the guy was a crackpot. The true source of the all-powerful signal? An early ADVENT chip transmitter. Somehow he got the bright idea of hooking into this thing, despite barely knowing what it actually did. His story was so ridiculous it almost made sense, I mean, none of us were scientists. And our solution was simple enough. We'd just blow up the transmitter and undo everything the DJ had put into motion. Simple."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="We came into the area near the waterfront. The chip transmitter was a ways off in the distance, so we didn't have a lot of time to wrap this up. Back then, there were only a few ADVENT city centers, and we didn't know a whole lot about their chip implants. I do remember thinking it was a strange place for a transmitter though, and I just hoped the DJ hadn't left anything else out."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Our exciting finale is still contingent on my survival."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="You're making a mockery of my story here."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_BombSpotted AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was hard to miss the transmitter. The DJ had done a number on the alien components to rig it up."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_BombPlanted AkEvent]
SpokenText="We planted the bomb. All we had do then was sit back and enjoy the show."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_BombDetonated AkEvent]
SpokenText="After all the trouble we went through, it was almost cathartic to blow up that final transmitter."

[Play_Sea_SabotageTransmitter_AreaSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had cleared out the surrounding aliens, but we still needed to blow up that transmitter and put an end to this."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="The latest problem was solved, but the DJ was still hiding something from us, and the Chryssalids were still taking over the coast. Things were about to come to a head."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We made it without much time to spare. We shut down the timed broadcast and spared the DJ's precious recordings."

[Play_Avenger_Interceptor_Wildnerss_Loading_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not sure it was intentional, but Shen left a bunch of her old audio logs open on the network. I don't think she'd mind if we listened to a few of 'em... but let's hurry up just in case."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to get into the DJ's computer and stop the broadcast before he brought down even more Chryssalids on us. If that was possible."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TimerNagFinal AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were right up against it, the broadcast was scheduled to go out any minute now."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TimerFailed AkEvent]
SpokenText="We definitely stopped the broadcast in time. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here to tell the story."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Timer3TurnsLeft AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ's next broadcast was going out soon-real soon. We had to hurry."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TerminalSpotted AkEvent]
SpokenText="That was when we first spotted the DJ's precious computer."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TerminalHacked AkEvent]
SpokenText="We stopped the broadcast, but there were still enemies in the area that we had to deal with."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_TerminalDestroyed AkEvent]
SpokenText="Yea...we did kinda promise the DJ we wouldn't destroy his computer, and I remember keeping my word on that."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't easy, but we fought our way through and finished the job."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I wouldn't say things went exactly smooth, but most of us survived, and we did manage to shut down the transmission before agitating even more of the undersea Chryssalid army."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="Even without the transmissions going off, the Chryssalids were still pouring out of the ocean like it was going out of style. I lost count of how many we killed, and it was about that time that I started to suspect that once again, the DJ had failed to clue us in on some critical detail."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="At this point we were all sick to death of dealing with the damn Chryssalids. I was starting to worry that even if we shut down all these transmissions, whatever undersea hellhole those things were coming from was only going to keep filling up the sea until they came ashore regardless."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't even get halfway there before we spotted the boat, mainly because it was already crawling with Chryssalids. There wasn't all that much to it, we knew we'd have to fight, and that's what we did."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="If we had had the Avenger back then, hell, even a Skyranger, we could have flown up and down the coast in a few hours and handled this without even setting foot on the ground. Our people don't realize how good they have it these days."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ pleaded with us not to destroy his computer along with his recordings, so we agreed that once we reached the boat we would hack in and shut down the broadcast. I'm not exactly sure why we had to hack in, it was his computer, but I don't remember anyone asking any questions at the time."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="At this point we were all sick to death of dealing with the damn Chryssalids. I was starting to worry that even if we shut down all these transmissions, whatever undersea hellhole those things were coming from was only going to keep filling up the sea until they came ashore regardless."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Remember when people used to complain about their GPS navigation maps? Well imagine using one of those...except directed by our DJ friend here. We might as well have been moving through the streets blind, it was that bad. I don't know what I was thinking. Like I said before, dumb ideas sinking into tired brains."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't even get halfway there before we spotted the boat, mainly because it was already crawling with Chryssalids. There wasn't all that much to it, we knew we'd have to fight, and that's what we did."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ had a few interesting items stashed away on his boat, I'm not really sure why though, he wasn't much for fighting. Probably used 'em for trading, I guess."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="To recap what we've learned so far, the DJ had taken alien technology, screwed around with it, and accidentally created Chryssalid lures that he then placed along the coast which attracted hordes of these monsters, from the ocean of all places. This is when I almost lost it, because this is when we found out about the DJ's boat docked outside another city further up the coast. On board was his computer, scheduled to broadcast the latest pre-recorded instalment of \"pirate\" radio. What choice did we have? We set off for yet another target."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="We barely had any time to reach the boat before that transmission was scheduled to inadvertently call in even more Chryssalids to the shore. There was no way to approach near the docks, so we had to work our way through the streets with the DJ giving us directions over the commlink."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Don't get discouraged. It's hard living up to the memory of me."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="As far as I know, I'm still alive and kickin' in the present day."

[Play_Sea_HackRadio_AreaSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="The area seemed kinda quiet, but we still had to find our way to the DJ's computer."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="So, now you know my pain. Even after the rescue, the guy just couldn't help himself. No situation was beyond his running commentary. I swear, he was just lucky we needed him to point out the rest of the stuff he installed."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It ended up being easier than it looked. We escaped with the DJ and there was no sign of ADVENT in pursuit."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="With the DJ in tow, we made it out of the city via boat and headed up the coast. It was time we finally found out what the hell was going on around here."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a tough fight getting in there, and even tougher getting out. If that DJ hadn't told us to what we wanted to hear, he might have wound up overboard."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took a beating to bring this guy in, and it was time for this so-called DJ to explain himself."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_I AkEvent]
SpokenText="You and I are gonna have a long talk later, but for now-do us all a favor-put a lid on it, buddy."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="We hadn't planned on it, but there was an old fishing trawler docked near the city that was still in seaworthy condition. With no specific destination in mind, there was no reason not to go after such an obvious exit. Of course, knowing we had to deal with underwater Chryssalids now, that did throw a small wrench in our plans."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't easy getting the DJ out of the city, 'cause of course he was completely useless in a fight. Still, he was our responsibility now and I wasn't about to let the aliens have him. If he was somehow responsible for bringing in those Chryssalids, I wanted to know how."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="Eventually we managed to link up with this DJ, he was about what you would expect-a damn lunatic. We didn't have a whole lot of time to discuss it in the heat of things, but it was clear he had been trying to build his own little radio network to cover the outlying territories."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="There was another makeshift radio tower and workshop pieced together in an old park inside the city. We knew the DJ or engineer, whatever they were, was holed up inside because the aliens were already trying to beat down the door by the time we got there."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was clear as soon as we got deeper into the city that we weren't the only ones looking for the person behind this signal. ADVENT patrols were scrounging around all over the place, and I wasn't about to let them get the answers before we did."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Not that it's any easier now, but moving through those cities weighed heavy on all of our minds. Ten years earlier there were thousands of people moving through there every day, now it was just one big tomb. I took a lot of solace in killing the aliens, every little piece of revenge meant something."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="Our new DJ friend had an interesting collection of scavenged tech and spare parts in his collection. We took the best stuff and left behind everything else."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Aside from our civic duty to rescue a fellow human in need, the only way we were going to shut down the rest of his broadcasts was if he pointed us towards the other equipment. He had been squirming for a few hours now, and apparently ADVENT was having trouble with the doors on his building-so of course, he was getting cocky-because he's an ass."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Intro_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="There was a boat docked near the waterfront that we eventually used as our EVAC point."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Intro_Alt_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="There was a boat docked near the waterfront that we eventually used as our EVAC point."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Intro_Alt_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we got into the city, the comm. signal was stronger than ever. We didn't have anything else to go on, so we used the transmission as a beacon."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Intro_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we got into the city, the comm. signal was stronger than ever but we still couldn't tell who or what it was. We didn't have anything else to go on, so we used the transmission as a beacon and headed in expecting the worst."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Believe it or not, we actually have a few recordings from the rescue-in fact, I'm not even gonna talk you through this part-the DJ did enough talking for the both of us."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Guard2Rescued AkEvent]
SpokenText="We grabbed the DJ's other guard on our way out."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Guard1Rescued AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not sure how the DJ convinced these people to guard him, but we managed to rescue one."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Despite my reputation, that performance was below average, even for me."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Let's go over this again. Maybe I forgot to mention something important."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_FacelessTunaSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Faceless didn't really have a name back then, but we knew they were out there, hiding among the civilians. This though...this was something else. I mean, if they could be fish, they could be anything, right? Where does it end?"

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_DJSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="That's our guy, the pirate of the airwaves himself."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_DJRescued AkEvent]
SpokenText="We secured the DJ, but now we had to babysit him until we got to the EVAC point."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_DJEvac AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ was safe, but the rest of the squad and I were still on the ground."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_DJDeath AkEvent]
SpokenText="He might be a pain in the ass, but the DJ definitely survived this particular adventure."

[Play_Sea_GatherDJ_DJandGuardsEvac AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ and his guards made it clear of the area. Now we just had to get ourselves out."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to get the DJ out of harm's way for the second time, and I wasn't about to let him wander off again. I parked him in a chair in front of one of our radio transmitters where he could give us directions to the next installation. I also quietly locked the door on my way out."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We killed what felt like dozens of Chryssalids, and finally we made it clear. Don't ask me how we pulled it off. I just know we did."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Despite the overwhelming odds against us, we managed to escape with the pacifist DJ safely in tow. By now I was getting tired of all this guy's surprises."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_TimerNagFinal AkEvent]
SpokenText="We're getting pretty close to the end of the line here. We weren't out there that long."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_TimerFailed AkEvent]
SpokenText="We're gonna have to go through it again, 'cause it definitely went quicker than that."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Timer6TurnsLeft AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had to get this whole thing done pretty quick, we had no idea just how bottomless the supply of Chryssalids was out there."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Timer3TurnsLeft AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had to keep moving. There was no time to stand around."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took a few hits here and there. The Chryssalids don't stop until they're dead. Fortunately we made it clear with the DJ alive and ready to steer us towards more problems."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="With that many Chryssalids, I was surprised we didn't take more casualties than we did. And of course the DJ made it without so much as a scratch, for all the hard work he put in."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="The more he talked, the more I realized this guy had a few screws loose. I was starting to worry his stupid ideas might actually sink in. We were all pretty tired, and we didn't have the energy to think his nonsense through."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="There wasn't a whole lot of time to get out of there, and there was no way we could fend off this many Chryssalids forever. If we didn't keep moving, there was a risk of being overrun entirely."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ had shown that he at least felt some contrition for his mistakes, and his heart was probably in the right place if it meant pissing ADVENT off. I wasn't ready to let him off the hook just yet though. We were still in the thick of his mess."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="To his credit, the DJ managed to keep his mouth shut for the most part despite a few close calls that almost cost him a limb. He had shown that he at least felt some contrition for his mistakes, and his heart was probably in the right place if it meant pissing ADVENT off."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="Like I said earlier, the DJ was essentially a walking target in combat. He refused to even pick up a gun, much less fight with one. The best we could hope for was that he kept his head down and his mouth shut until we reached the EVAC point."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had to cover some ground to reach a safe point to make a break for it. We didn't have Big Sky or Firebrand to bail us out back then, we all had to rely on our feet to save us."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The signal in this area was already down, but the Chryssalids were still coming out of the woodwork. I didn't give a damn about the DJ's records, but that didn't stop him from ignoring the fact that we were out here protecting him while he nursed his alleged back injury."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The signal in this area was down, but the Chryssalids were still coming out of the woodwork. The DJ said something about being too close to the source, but we didn't have time to press him on it in the middle of combat."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We picked through the settlement and salvaged what we could, we were slowly piecing together some decent gear but we had to choose carefully."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="After all that work to rescue this guy, not a day later he somehow thought it would be a good idea to wander off in search of his old record collection or something. I almost lost it that day. I was about ready to just leave him to the Chryssalids. Fortunately, he hadn't managed to get very far, and we put a leash on him before the aliens could."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="The DJ had set up his equipment in an old utility building that the locals built their settlement around. It almost felt safe at first, but the signal there must have been stronger, 'cause the Chryssalids were overrunning the entire area."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now you're just selling me short. Come on, I'm way tougher than that."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="No...pretty sure that's not what happened."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_DJEvac AkEvent]
SpokenText="For the second time now, we had ushered the DJ to safety, no thanks to him."

[Play_Sea_ExtractDJ_DJDeath AkEvent]
SpokenText="Maybe I wasn't totally clear, but we did save the DJ."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="So now we knew the DJ had gotten his hands on some real alien technology, not the pretty homogenized gear that ADVENT uses-the old spooky stuff. That upped the stakes for everyone, and we were definitely on the aliens' radar now."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We destroyed the transmitter before the Chryssalids completely overran our position. Now that we knew we were dealing with alien technology, I had a feeling things were going to ramp up real quick."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to destroy the transmitter and cut off the signal, but that was only enough to stop the onslaught for a few miles in each direction. There was still work to be done."

SpokenText="I don't remember it taking this long. We're probably pushing the limits of the story here."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_TimerNag AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Chryssalids were only gonna keep coming, we had a limited window of survival here."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_TimerExpired AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were definitely quicker than that. We would have been overrun by then."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_RadioSpotted AkEvent]
SpokenText="That was around the time we first set eyes on the DJ's transmitter."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_RadioDestroyed AkEvent]
SpokenText="That was one transmitter down, but our job wasn't done yet."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took some losses, but at the end of the day the transmitter was down and we had a temporary reprieve from the Chryssalid hordes."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The fights kept getting tougher, but we still pulled it off. The local transmitter was down and the Chryssalids were no doubt already on their way to the next target."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's not like we weren't going to go after him, but I didn't see the harm in letting him sweat for a few hours. We'd get there in time, probably."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="I almost felt bad about wishing ADVENT on him-almost. I mean, he did bring it on himself. Stolen equipment aside, did he think the aliens were just gonna let him mouth-off all day with no reprisal? We all know the aliens love a good reprisal."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was either bad luck, or just stupid coincidence, but for whatever reason the DJ had installed his transmitter on the dock right near the water's edge. He had unknowingly positioned this thing to be the most efficient Chryssalid bait possible."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we actually got close enough to see the transmitter, it was clear as day that our DJ had failed to mention one critical detail. The damn thing was pure alien technology, and not even ADVENT's stuff, something older. To this day I still have no idea how he had managed to get any of it working, but it was all starting to make a lot more sense."

SpokenText="It was either bad luck, or just a stupid coincidence, but for whatever reason the DJ had installed his transmitter on the dock right near the water's edge. He had unknowingly positioned this thing to be the most efficient Chryssalid bait possible."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="For all we knew about the alien technology back then, whatever this transmitter was the DJ stole from ADVENT, it could have been doing exactly what it was originally designed for. Maybe the aliens needed them to corral the Chryssalids. Maybe they didn't even have control of all these monsters."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="There were plenty of aliens lurking around the area approaching the transmitter, but it didn't seem like they were too worried about the prospect of Chryssalids. They had probably assumed the signal was tied to one of the early resistance cells and came in to clean house."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="There was some salvageable equipment among the aliens we took out, but we didn't have a whole lot of time to take inventory."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="We made our way further up the coast by boat while chasing the DJ's signal. From what we pieced together, he had been building his own radio network across the territories that were still free from ADVENT control. Rigging stolen relays and antennas up and down the seaboard to get his message across, he had managed to stir something else up. Whether it was the frequency or something in the equipment itself...the Chryssalids loved the sound of his voice. To them, it was like the DJ had been ringing the dinner bell in every town he visited."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now that we had a working theory as to what was attracting the Chryssalids, all we had to do was go in and destroy all the equipment the DJ had already installed. Sounds easy enough, right? Well it wasn't...the closer we got, the more trouble we found."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Maybe we should stretch our legs, try this again later."

[Play_Sea_DestroyRadio_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now it wouldn't be an epic tale of victory if I went out like that, would it?"

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Upgrades AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had seen the town firsthand and confirmed the rumors, by all accounts the responsible party was some sort of new Chryssalid that liked to hang around underwater of all places. As you can imagine, we were all thrilled to learn of yet another new monster inhabiting our world."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Eventually we killed off the waves of Chryssalids pouring into town, but we still didn't know what was riling them up in the first place."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to clear out the Chryssalids without any casualties, but at this point we still had no idea what was going on."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things got a little ugly on that first outing. Nobody was expecting Chryssalids. Fortunately, most of us made it out alive."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Chryssalids almost got the jump on us. Not everyone made it, but we managed to clear out the initial waves swarming the town."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_NeonateChryssalidSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="They came from the sea...that's what stood out. They were just giant bugs to us back then, we didn't know anything about the science. Chryssalids. Strange ones too, white...like they were covered in bone."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_J AkEvent]
SpokenText="Somehow I just knew, wherever we ended up, whatever we were doing...we were gonna keep hearing this clown until we confronted him-or until the aliens blew his brains out-and by that point, I'm not sure if I cared which one of us got to him first."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_H AkEvent]
SpokenText="He had spent the last ten minutes babbling about hamburgers while we were out there watching people mutate into Chryssalids from all the poison. Honestly one of the worst things I've ever seen, and this guy was our soundtrack the whole damn time."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="There's a time and place for everything, and I'll admit it, if I'd been sitting around the campfire having a few drinks, this guy probably would have been kinda funny, in an insane way. But during the heat of combat with a bunch of weird ocean Chryssalids running us down? I would have given anything to shut him up."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="The fact that there were Chryssalids in the ocean was news to me, and worse still something was drawing them into the town. I must have killed half a dozen of 'em at least and they just kept coming."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="Radio chatter aside, we had a much bigger problem to contend with. The rumors were true, the aliens had hit this town. And you know what? We would have welcomed a good fight with ADVENT versus what we actually ran into that day."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="Approaching the docks, it was clear right away what the problem was here, and it was a big one."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't until we got close to town that we started picking up these transmissions...we didn't know what to make of it. It sure as hell wasn't ADVENT, and no one in the resistance was stupid enough to leave the aliens with a signal to follow."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had come here on the vague word of a trader who moved between these outlying towns, she said her local contacts were spooked by something...enough that they refused to take her up the coast by boat."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT brought in some equipment for the troops stationed at the local outpost. We were able to scrounge up a few things but we couldn't take everything."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Loading_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="<sigh> some things never change. Did I ever tell you the story of how we first met that crackpot? Get comfortable, you'll like this one. It all started about 12 years ago..."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="I had been working with a few local operators, helping people out on the fringes wherever we could. In this case, we were following up on some rumors about the aliens hitting a town out on the coast. We just figured ADVENT was finally getting down to the stragglers."

[Play_Sea_Abduction_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Chryssalids were definitely nasty, but clearly I didn't turn into one."

[Play_Marketing_08 AkEvent]

[Play_Marketing_07_ALTD AkEvent]
SpokenText="But that's not the whole story, and I think it's time I finally filled in some of those gaps in our history for you."

[Play_Marketing_07_ALTC AkEvent]
SpokenText="But I don't want you to think we were just sitting around while you were gone."

[Play_Marketing_07_ALTB AkEvent]

[Play_Marketing_07_ALTA AkEvent]
SpokenText="But that's not exactly the whole story."

[Play_Marketing_07 AkEvent]

[Play_Marketing_02 AkEvent]

[Play_Marketing_01 AkEvent]
SpokenText="Only we can keep the stories alive, Commander."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Everyone felt a lot better knowing ADVENT wasn't going to be firing their new gun anytime soon, especially if they planned on pointing it at us."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't see another cannon like that for years, so I like to think we set ADVENT's research back a ways by blowing up that thing."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a hard fight, maybe harder than we were hoping for, but at the end of the day ADVENT had one less toy to play around with."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT did everything they could to stop us, but we managed to see the job through despite taking some casualties."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Little did we know that we would end up seeing another version of their cannon again in the future, and they almost got us with it too... but that's another story altogether."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="If the Avenger had been flight-worthy at the time, I might have suggested we try to steal ADVENT's new toy rather than destroy it- would have made for a hell of a deck gun. Still, it's hard to describe how pretty it was when we finally lit that thing up."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had to figure this cannon of theirs was meant to be pointed at us, I mean, there just wasn't anyone else out there worth hitting with a gun that big. The Avenger was the biggest threat on ADVENT's radar, and they had built a weapon worthy of shooting us out of the sky."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="With Jane onboard, I probably could have handed off command of the squad to her, but back then I'll admit I was eager for action. The aliens had taken so much from us. There was something satisfying about returning the favor to them directly."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="If we had had time to plan out something a little more subtle, Shen probably could have rigged the cannon's power source to overload once they eventually tried to use it. In this case, we always had our faithful X4 to fall back on."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I considered the possibility that we might be walking into an elaborate trap, but ADVENT had provided a prime target whether it was a setup or not.  Letting it go wasn't an option at this point."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="Blowing up anything that belonged to the aliens was great for morale, and we saw a nice boost in resistance chatter in the days after taking out the cannon. Shen figures that thing could have potentially wiped out a whole town, so we definitely saved some lives on this one."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="That explosion took out most of what ADVENT brought with them, but Shen still managed to salvage a few components to improve our gear."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Within a few weeks of scooping up Jane from the slums, we got word from one of her scouts that the aliens were moving something across the territories-something big. We couldn't always count on these reports to be accurate, but from the description it sure sounded like a weapon to me. If it was really as big as Jane's guy claimed, it didn't matter where they were hauling it off to, we couldn't risk it. If we were going to lead the resistance, then we had to start acting like it. That meant taking the fight to them."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we hit the ground it was obvious we had made the right choice in coming after this thing-it was some kind of artillery piece-bigger than anything we had ever seen in ADVENT's arsenal. The aliens weren't expecting an attack, but the area was still crawling with ADVENT regulars providing security."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Don't get discouraged. It happens to the best of us."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not saying it was easy, but it also wasn't that hard."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Bomb_NoRNF AkEvent]
SpokenText="We planted the bomb on ADVENT's cannon. Now we just needed to get clear before the fireworks."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_Bomb_Detonated AkEvent]
SpokenText="Boom! It was quite a show, I really can't describe it."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueVehicle_AreaClear AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had cleared the area, all we had to do now was plant the bomb."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan probably could have handled the situation differently, but at the end of the day, he was with us now, and that was all that really mattered."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Hauling Tygan's body out of the tunnels was a real pain in the ass, but we really did need him, and he's proven to be an invaluable asset to the resistance in the time since."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_TimerExpired AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's been too long already. We had to be faster than that."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Fighting in the tunnels was no easy task, and took a toll on some our people. We got Tygan out there though, and that was sure to slow down whatever ADVENT had him doing."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan had enough burdens to bear without the weight of our casualties holding him down. He felt responsible, but loss was something we all had to learn to deal with."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_ObjSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan must have really done a number on himself. He was passed out through the whole mission."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_ObjDestroyed AkEvent]
SpokenText="We need Tygan alive, for obvious reasons."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Nag6turns AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had a limited window of opportunity to work with here. ADVENT was bound to notice Tygan's abrupt departure from their network quickly."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Nag3turns AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were running out of time. ADVENT was sending reinforcements to check in on Tygan's lab."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Nag1turn AkEvent]
SpokenText="That's about as much time as we had. Beyond that, ADVENT definitely would have cornered us down there."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="It took some time before Tygan gained the crew's trust, I think even today Shen still keeps her guard up around him despite all the work they've done together. At this point I'd say give the guy a break, but maybe I'm just getting soft with old age."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="You have to remember, when this all went down, all we knew about these ADVENT implants was that they were starting to pop up in most of the city centers. Tygan was likely among the first humans ever implanted with one, and he was definitely the first person to ever try pulling one out."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan knew it wouldn't take ADVENT all that long to notice he was no longer tied into their network, but that didn't stop him from pulling the plug anyway. I don't want to make any presumptions about his mindset, but it was clear he had had enough of whatever he was doing down in that lab of his."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_C_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="When we finally found him, the good doctor was out cold. Not only did we have to carry this guy out of the tunnels, for all we knew he had accidentally lobotomized himself in the process."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="When we finally found him, the good doctor was out cold. He hadn't bothered to warn us of his plan before putting himself under the knife, and I sure as hell wasn't happy about it. Not only did we have to carry this guy out of the tunnels, for all we knew he had accidentally lobotomized himself in the process."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Having lost all contact with Dr. Vahlen after the invasion, our growing resistance movement was in desperate need of anyone with medical expertise. Had our original chief scientist still been with us, I'm not sure we would have taken such a great risk rescuing a former collaborator. At least in those days. Don't tell him I said that."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_A_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens had Tygan working out of a lab space down in the tunnels under one of the city centers. Aside from the fact that he was collaborating with the enemy, I could see why he would want to get out of his current situation - the place was a dungeon."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens had Tygan working out of a lab space down in the tunnels under one of the city centers. Aside from the fact that he was collaborating with the enemy, I can see why he would want to get out of his current situation. Aside from his equipment, the place was kind of a dungeon."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="It took a while before Tygan was in any condition to talk, much less help out around the ship. He did send us off on one last adventure though, and I'd bet money you'll never guess how this next part turns out."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't remember grabbing anything of value from Tygan's underground lair, much to his dismay. Shen was still reliably churning out the upgrades though, so we were doing all right."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Loading_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Prior to Ramirez's capture, she was on route to help facilitate the defection of a prominent ADVENT doctor, none other than our old friend, Dr. Tygan.  When she didn't show for the meet, the good doctor panicked and, well, took matters into his own hands. Literally. Tygan somehow removed his implant chip from the base of his own skull in probably the world's greatest and most brutal display of self-surgery. The procedure worked, but rendered him unconscious.  It also alerted ADVENT authorities to what he was up to."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now this part of the story, this is something you won't hear about very often, the origins of Doctor Tygan's relationship with XCOM. He wasn't exactly captured, but when we got to him, he was... at the end of his rope, desperate to get away from ADVENT. So desperate in fact that in a hastily performed fit of self-mutilation, Tygan removed his own chip implant the hard way-through the back of the skull. Needless to say that rendered him unconscious, and with only hours to spare before the aliens realized what he had done."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Intro_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Thankfully Ramirez had details on Tygan's last known position. We may have been a little late, but we were still determined to show up. Had we not, Tygan would have found himself with an even bigger hole in the back of his head."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan made contact with one of our people close to ADVENT before pulling the plug on his chip. It was sheer luck that we were in a position to send a team after him. A few days earlier and he might have found himself with an even bigger hole in the back of his head."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan's probably down in his lab if you want to confirm the story before we try again."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueTygan_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I've seen enough ADVENT burger wrappers around this ship to know at least one thing...Tygan lived."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_TotalVictory_B_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't just an artifact we found that day, it was something more.  Hope. In Extra-large size."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I was skeptical of what we found, I mean, why the hell would they have my sweater all tubed-up like that?"

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_TotalVictory_A_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan's intel paid off.  We got the artifact and returned to base.  All of us.  (beat)  I just hope it hadn't shrunk."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Well, what can I say? We found my sweater, but I wasn't exactly gung-ho to throw it on again before finding out what the aliens did to it. I just hoped it hadn't shrunk."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_SweaterReveal_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="After all these years, reunited. It had been so long, what had the aliens done to it, I wondered. Would...could things ever be the same?"

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_SweaterReveal AkEvent]
SpokenText="I can't tell you exactly what I said when that chamber opened...all I could think was...why? Of all things, they took my damnsweater?! And why was it in containment?"

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_SweaterAvailable_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Tygan's allowed Shen to run a few scans on the artifact. While replicating it in its entirety is still decades beyond all of our understanding, she was able to infuse some of its properties into our existing materials."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_SweaterAvailable AkEvent]
SpokenText="I reminded Shen about the long-forgotten sweater project she had been working on. And wouldn't you know it? I hear she's been handing out some kind of knock-off sweaters for the troops. As much as I missed it, I still haven't decided if I'm ready to put that thing back on yet."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_PartialVictory_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="We paid a heavy cost that day, but prevailed.  Had the aliens truly understood what they possessed, none of us would be alive today to hear this tale."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_PartialVictory_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="We came back with the sweater, but there were a lot of questions among the troops about the risks we just took for something with no obvious value."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens might not have fully understood what they had in their hands that day, but they knew enough to make damn sure it wasn't easy for us to get it out of there."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't even have a theory as to why the aliens wanted my sweater, but they made damn sure it wasn't easy for us to get it out of there."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Outro AkEvent]
SpokenText="I didn't know whether to kiss Tygan or kick him off the ship. He could have just told us it was my missing sweater all along...I would have still gone in after it."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_ObjDestroyed AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had come too far just to blow the thing up, whatever it was."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_F_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Aside from Gatecrasher, this one was of the last tactical operations I took the lead on, and to be honest, it was probably for the best. I put my body through a lot over the years, and it was getting harder and harder to keep up with our new recruits. Plus, I knew it was time to start being a real leader."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Aside from Gatecrasher, this one was of the last tactical operations I took the lead on, and to be honest, it was probably for the best. I put my body through a lot over the years, and it was getting harder and harder to keep up with our new recruits. Plus, I knew it was time to try being a real leader."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="Facilities like this were an important reminder of just how far ADVENT had come over the years. Building something like this was a huge undertaking, and there was no telling how many more of these places were out there. It was daunting to consider, but we tried to focus on the task at hand."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="As things dragged on, my patience for this scavenger hunt was getting thin, to the point where I almost had them haul Tygan out of bed to give us some clue as to what we were doing down here. He was certainly giving the Elders a run for the \"most indecipherable statements\" award."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="I think just about everyone on the squad had a theory as to what it was we would find in there. If I had known Tygan then as well as I do now, I would have put my money on it being the recipe for ADVENT burger's secret sauce."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It also dawned on me that if the aliens were any good at espionage, Tygan would have made for the perfect bait. We rescue him, he gives us the location of some weapon we can't pass up, and we send a team of our best people into an ambush. Still, it ended up being worth it."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Retelling the story now, it doesn't make much sense that we would have followed a half-baked lead into an unknown alien facility. But that's XCOM for ya, always chasing something. Besides, I don't know what it was, but I had a strange feeling going into this one."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_MissionSummary_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Seen a lot of crazy things in this war but still, not enough to ever let me believe I'd be reunited with the artifact again. Tygan and the lab techs have taken it away for further study. And much as I'd like to stop them, I guess I can't blame them.  A lot's changed over the years, myself included.  Am I even the same man I was back then?"

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="I didn't know whether to kiss Tygan or kick him off the ship. He could have just told us it was my missing sweater all along... I would have still gone in after it. Come to think of it, I'm not exactly sure whatever happened to that thing. Last I heard, Shen was giving it a thorough onceover."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="After all that work, Shen decided we might as well get something for our efforts. With that in mind, I hear she's been handing out some kind of knock-off sweaters for the troops. As much as I missed it, I still haven't decided if I'm ready to put that thing back on yet."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once he finally recovered from the operation, our new friend Doctor Tygan was grateful, to the extent that Tygan expresses that sort of thing anyway. He was also eager to prove his loyalty, to shake off whatever bad deeds he had done in the service of ADVENT. He told us about a powerful artifact, a remnant of the old XCOM base the aliens had found and sealed away deep in some stronghold for further study. He was vague about the whole thing, which didn't help alleviate any suspicions we might have had about his story. Still, it was worth a shot."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Whatever we were after, the aliens buried it deep in a stronghold unlike anything we'd ever run into. The only way in was through an old ventilation shaft, dropping down through the ceiling. Even the aliens had to breathe sometime, I guess."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Failure_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="There's no way in hell I was coming back without that thing.  Let's try this again."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We've come this far, might as well try again and see this through."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="You know the drill. Try it again."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_ChamberSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="When we spotted that final chamber, I knew that had to be the place. They had really gone out of their way to build this reveal."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueSweater_AreaClear AkEvent]
SpokenText="We cleared out the secret facility, now we just had to find the mysterious \"object of power\" Tygan alluded to."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen was safely returned to the Avenger, but of course that didn't stop her from heading out again not long after."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were lucky to have found Shen before the aliens did God knows what with her. That was the last time I let her go on a walkabout without a proper security detail in tow."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_ShenSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had freed Shen, but we still had to get clear of the ADVENT facility."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_ShenLost AkEvent]
SpokenText="Now we both know Shen can't die for this story to make any sense."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't the cleanest operation, but we got Shen home safe and not much worse for wear."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen didn't take the news of our casualties lightly, but no one was blaming her for what happened. We all knew what we signed up for."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen was held under some kind of Psionic \"stasis\" for most of her time at the compound, but she was awake long enough to see a few of the other prisoners. She could tell by the condition they were in that they came from the slums outside of one of the city centers. If they were resistance cell leaders, we needed to find out."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="The ADVENT compound was a clandestine holding facility, and it was definitely built to house a lot more people than Shen alone. They had obviously been at this for a while now. We found evidence of other prisoners... but no one left alive besides our girl."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were all relieved to find Shen alive and ticking, and surprisingly enough not much worse for wear. I'll tell you what, the aliens sure could have learned a thing or two about interrogation techniques from our old friend Dr. Vahlen - good luck finding her though."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="Security wasn't overly tight at the compound, ADVENT's new team was obviously hoping stealth and smaller numbers would keep their operations under wraps. We were just fortunate the few contacts we had made at that point managed to help us find Shen."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Between the growing number of resistance cells popping up around the world, and our local operations to rebuild the Avenger, the Elders must have been getting nervous. The new ADVENT team was decent in combat, but as we learned, that wasn't their primary focus-and they had been plenty busy."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I should be clear on this, rescuing Shen was personal-she was our friend and part of the team. But from a strategic standpoint, rescuing Shen was a make-or-break operation for the future of the resistance. Without her, the Avenger would never fly again, and we wouldn't have half the tech we have today."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Mission_Summary AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen's abduction was a wake-up call. Not that we hadn't been taking security seriously, but now we really had to be on our toes if we wanted to keep our secrets safe from the Elders. As it turned out, they had already cast a wide net on the hunt for our allies."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="If we were gonna to chase the ADVENT extraction team across the continent in hopes of finding their other prisoners, we were going to need some better equipment."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="So here's a story Shen probably didn't mention from her various excursions off the ship - the time she was captured by ADVENT. Yeah, that's right, captured by ADVENT. This wasn't that long ago either, just a few years back. The aliens knew the Avenger was out here somewhere, and they started getting real desperate to find it. They even assembled a special extraction team, almost like they were trying to mirror our tactics. The ADVENT squad was grabbing senior resistance targets for interrogation, and Shen had the misfortune of being one of the first. Or so we thought."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT's black-bag squad had taken Shen to a compound out in the middle of nowhere. I took charge of the rescue myself. If anything had happened to her...well, you can imagine. In hindsight, I was definitely worried. We really had no idea what they were planning to do with her."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Trust me, you're not communing with the spirits. I'm still here."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueShen_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="You and I both know that's not how this went down."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez was already serving XCOM unofficially before we rescued her, but it felt right having her finally join the crew as a full-fledged operative."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez was basically one of our own at this point, and there was no way we were going to just leave her out there. Luckily, it didn't come to that."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_TargetLost_ALTA AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez had bigger things ahead of her. Her number wasn't up yet."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_TargetLost_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez had bigger things ahead of her. This wasn't her time."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_TargetLost AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez had bigger things ahead of her. This wasn't the right time."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not sure how many of Ramirez' recruits survived the attack, but she made it out alive along with most of our team."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things got a little hairy down there, but we managed to pull Ramirez out without setting ourselves back too much."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_ObjSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez made it clear of the AO."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once Ramirez officially joined the Avenger's crew, she stayed on in her capacity as a teacher when she wasn't out killing aliens. She actually helped design some of the training facilities we're using today."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="Come to think of it, I'm not sure we ever did get the story from Ramirez on what led to the raid on her stomping grounds. I wanna say we decided that it wasn't an infiltrator, but the overzealous use of improvised explosives, that eventually caught the aliens' attention."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="From my perspective, the only way ADVENT had any chance of finding Ramirez on her turf was if someone from the inside gave up her position. There were a lot of fresh faces among her recruits, and it could have been any one of 'em. We also had the faceless to consider."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="When ADVENT started cracking down on livestock and homegrown crops, survival skills like foraging and gathering were all that some people had left to go on. For the others that couldn't just flip a switch and become self-reliant, the city centers were the only choice they had."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The thing about Ramirez was, despite all the time she spent on her own, she never turned into the kind of loner crackpot you'd normally find out there. For some of us, the isolation of surviving on the fringes was almost too much to handle. Not Ramirez. When we finally picked her up, she was as sharp as any XCOM recruit we had ever had."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="In the old days, Ramirez was what you would have called a \"survivalist.\" I don't know her exact motivations, but she had taken to living off the grid well before the invasion even started. While things were falling apart for everyone else, isolation kept Ramirez out of the aliens' sights."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="Ramirez was the real deal, one of the best we ever had. Losing her and Osei on Gatecrasher was a tough blow, but it was because of their sacrifice that we have you leading us today, Commander."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We gathered up what we could from the remains of Ramirez's training area, but it's not like the recruits she was working with had the best gear to begin with."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was no surprise that ADVENT had made an attempt on Ana Ramirez. What was surprising was that they actually managed to find her. See, Ramirez was one of the finest guerrilla operators we had run into, so much so that we had convinced her to start training recruits of her own to spread the knowledge around. I'm not one to sing the praises of ADVENT, but even I'll admit it, I was impressed they tracked her down. Still, Ramirez is no easy mark. She managed to get a signal through to us right when ADVENT hit her camp."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="We knew Ramirez wouldn't back down from the fight, so if we had any intention of keeping her alive, we'd have to work fast. She had been training recruits in an old freight yard for a few months now, and I guess her little school had finally outgrown the shadows."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I think Ramirez deserves a little better than that."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="If I told Ramirez how you handled this, you might find yourself doing laps around the ship, Commander."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueRamirez_VIPacquired AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't think Ramirez was expecting us, but she was definitely relieved."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_VIPacquired AkEvent]
SpokenText="Osei was all smiles once he laid eyes on us."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="To be honest, I was actually surprised with how well our foray into the city went. We managed to snatch Osei without breaking a sweat."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Osei's ego might have taken a big hit being captured by ADVENT, but once we set him free, you never would have known anything went down."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_TargetLost AkEvent]
SpokenText="Osei didn't go out like that. Let's not forget it."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We all knew the risks going into the city, and it was as tough as we expected it would be. Still, we got Osei, and that was a win."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I had expected we might take some casualties heading into the city, but we managed to pull off Osei's rescue with manageable losses."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_ObjSecure AkEvent]
SpokenText="We got Osei out of there as quick as we could, despite his enthusiasm for a fight."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="XCOM needed a guy like Osei. We had more than enough grim faces and serious attitudes as it was. Losing him on Gatecrasher was a tough blow, even with all the good cheer surrounding the Commander's return."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was no secret that Osei loved the attention ADVENT had been giving him. If I was trying to avoid attention, he was more than happy to be soaking it up. He wasn't all that chipper when we found him in that ADVENT jail, that's for sure."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="The other problem with moving inside the city centers was the propaganda. ADVENT had taken to aggressively posting resistance mugshots, surveillance footage, renderings, anything they could find to put our faces up in lights. It was exactly the kind of attention we didn't need."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="For the most part, I had our people avoiding the city centers whenever possible. Security was through the roof, with ADVENT checkpoints and chip scanners on every major thoroughfare. In retrospect, this mission was the closest thing we had to a trial run for our eventual rescue of the Commander."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="With his failed sabotage attempt on the ADVENT cannon, Osei and most of his team wound up in the nearest city center jail. Unfortunately for the others, by the time we got in there, he was the only one they were still keeping alive."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Osei was a man after my own heart, a gung-ho leader who was willing to put his own ass on the line to stop ADVENT when- and wherever he could. He may not have been a strategic mastermind, but he certainly had a knack for finding interesting targets to drive the aliens crazy."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="Osei was certainly grateful for the rescue, and he ended up being one of our most loyal soldiers right up until the end. I think he'd be happy to know we're still talking about him even today. He was also the one who first introduced us to Ramirez, so we owe him a debt of gratitude for that beyond his service."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had been grabbing ADVENT gear whenever possible. It gave Shen a shot at reverse-engineering their latest tech."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't until later we found out who it was ADVENT had captured trying to blow up their cannon. Peter Osei and his Wrecking Crew were one of the only groups willing to venture into the city centers, and he made quite a reputation for himself taking down high value ADVENT targets. As you might imagine, that also put him on a short list of resistance targets that the aliens were falling all over themselves to capture or kill. In Osei's case, he was finally rounded up during the convoy raid, and now he found himself imprisoned in the heart of the city."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Even people not willing to associate with the resistance had heard of Osei in those days, especially in the cities. It would have been a huge blow to morale if we had let ADVENT execute him, not that that was our only motivation."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Let's start from the beginning."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueOsei_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'll walk you through it again. Maybe I forgot something."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_VIPacquired AkEvent]
SpokenText="We managed to free Jane just in time for her to jump into the fight."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Jane was more than happy to see us, and we were just as happy to have her joining our crew."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Rescuing Jane would end up being a huge boon to our forces in the future. I just wish we had ten more like her."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_TargetLost AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't lose Jane here. Maybe I wasn't clear on that point."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="When all was said and done, Jane made sure every soldier on that squad knew how much she appreciated their efforts to save someone they had never even met."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't easy getting Jane away from ADVENT, but we pulled through and got the job done."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_ObjSecured AkEvent]
SpokenText="Jane was safe and secure, the latest XCOM recruit, ready to serve."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_F_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's easy to see it now, but I never would have guessed just how valuable Jane would eventually be to our future operations. Aside from the Commander, she's way more famous than the rest of us.  Hell, just ask the Chosen."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's easy to see it now, but I never would have guessed just how valuable Jane would eventually be to our future operations. Aside from the Commander, she's way more famous than the rest of us. Hell, even the Chosen have heard of her these days."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT was risking a lot trying to bring our people in alive for interrogation, that's how I knew they were starting to worry about what we might do with the Avenger. Just think where we might be today if they'd gone ahead and executed everyone."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="Once we set her loose, Jane was eager to jump back into the fight. I almost felt guilty about depriving her team of a gifted leader, but if XCOM was going to spearhead the resistance, we needed the best people we could find leading the way."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="Despite running an active and eager resistance cell, Jane was known for her surprisingly quiet, calculating demeanor. While most of the resistance groups were guided by the charisma of their leaders, these \"Earthers\" followed Jane because of her skills, not her words."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="At the time, I had never heard of Jane or her crew, but local rumors had talked them up to be the nastiest bunch of alien killing maniacs west of the Mississippi. If what they said was true, I was more than happy to risk a rescue if it meant recruiting a few more heavy operators for XCOM."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had been establishing contact with resistance cells wherever we could, but there were still plenty of groups out there operating on their own agendas. As we discovered that day, the local contingent called themselves \"Children of the Earth\" ...and it was their esteemed leader Jane Kelly that ADVENT had set their sights on."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="Aside from her prowess in combat, Jane had her own network of contacts that proved to be invaluable in the days ahead. In fact, from what I recall it was one of her people that pointed us towards our next target."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were always on the lookout for fresh gear, especially with the growing number of recruits we had coming in."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen was pretty out of it most of her time with ADVENT, but she swore up and down that she had heard something about the aliens moving people by train. With that in mind, we were able to narrow down the locations where ADVENT was actively moving trains near the city center slums. We didn't know who we might find down there, but it was up to us to defend anyone willing to stand with the resistance. Who would have guessed it would end up being one of XCOM's greatest heroes?"

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Shen was right. ADVENT's extraction team had pulled a train right into the slums outside the city and were using it as a prison on wheels. Whoever they were holding was obviously pretty important, so we figured it was probably best to get them on our side."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I know it seems hard, but we pulled it off eventually."

[Play_Lazarus_RescueKelly_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Most of the people on that team are still working with us today, so we must have survived somehow."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Finding the sanctuary in ruins wasn't the outcome any of us had hoped for, but we were alive, and that was something at least."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a tough fight, but we made it out of the freight yard in fine shape. The squad was feeling good at this point."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Considering what the aliens had been throwing at us, it felt good to have made it out of this one alive. Still, what happened to the sanctuary...that wasn't something you just forget."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took some losses, a few ugly hits, but most of us managed to get past the freight yard alive."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't remember who, but someone in the group joked that we should come up with a name for our little resistance cell. When I heard that, I knew they saw it too. We weren't taking orders from above. We were a squad now."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="During the invasion, the Elders kept a short leash on some of their wilder creations, but they weren't holding back anymore. We may have been the first humans to see some of these things up close - made for a good test of our resolve."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="I like to think that at a certain point, some alien commander or ADVENT officer noticed our little path of destruction, and just for that one instant felt a sense of panic. The map had led us through bigger and better targets, and we had met every challenge."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was probably stupid of us to think we'd find some safe haven, some respite from the real world. We had all been out here long enough to know better, but even I had let my guard down a little bit just this once. Never again."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Whatever hope our group had of finding a sanctuary here had all but disappeared. We were all knotted up, blinded by rage. We were hungry for a fight now. We wanted their whole damn army after us. And from what I remember, they were happy to oblige."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_ALT_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="Stockyards and feed lots across the country collapsed from the work stoppages. There was no place for these trains to go, and no one to move them. In an unlikely coincidence, ADVENT banned the possession of livestock outright around the same time. That was the breaking point for a lot of people. Migration to the cities wasn't a choice anymore. It was a necessity of survival."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_ALT_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens blasted chokepoints along all of the major rail routes and highways across the continent, wiped out the global economy in a matter of weeks. Most of our biggest cities only had a three-day supply of food on hand, and with no new deliveries coming, things descended into chaos real quick."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_ALT_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens eventually repurposed and upgraded some of our existing rail routes. High speed trains helped them lock down Earth's resources for logistical control. ADVENT-approved rations became the primary source of food for millions, buying our loyalty one meal at a time."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Maybe they thought they could get one of the trains running again to leave town, we were never sure. But what we found...what we found was nothing short of a massacre...the aliens had left no stone unturned. I had seen a lot of things I never expected back then, but this was something worse."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="If there had been anything resembling a sanctuary at the freight yard, the aliens hadn't left any trace of it. There were still a few more locations marked on the map though, so we held out hope that maybe the survivors had moved on before it was too late."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We pulled whatever we could off the aliens, and scrounged up a few things from the freight yard before moving on."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Past the bar on the outskirts of town was the freight yard, and according to the map, this is where the sanctuary was supposed to be. We found some old trail markers, symbols people called the hobo code back in the day. None of us actually knew what the signs meant, but we got the distinct impression we were being warned to steer clear. We had already come too far, and if the aliens had gotten to these people, we had to know for sure."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="The freight yard hadn't been in operation since the war started...with few exceptions, interstate commerce had all but ground to a halt by this point. I'm sure the old box cars made for a tempting place to hide when the aliens rolled up on the town. Unfortunately, if anyone had survived, there was no sign of them when we showed up. I can't say we weren't disappointed. There was no sanctuary here...and if there ever was, the aliens had done their worst."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_GraffitiSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="We noticed some other strange graffiti on a few of the old boxcars...I'm not sure what it meant, but it didn't look good.  We didn't really have time to stand around guessing though."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Yeah, it was ugly down there, but not thatugly."

[Play_Blast_Trainyard_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Maybe I'm not describing the situation clearly. I survived."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were all more than ready to put this town behind us."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We cleared the police station and moved on as quickly as we could. There was nothing left of this town to save anymore."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="As hazy as my memory might be, I'll never forget the faces of the people we lost out there."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Every casualty, every loss... they just made me angrier, more driven to fight."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't know it at the time, but I suppose this whole situation is even sadder when you consider that most of these aliens are just pawns in the Elders' game.  Not that I feel bad for 'em, but do you think the Elders care how many of these things we killed?"

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="If a bunch of civilians were willing to stand up to ADVENT knowing they didn't have a chance in hell, what would history have said about us if we had turned and run away? None of us had any intention of leaving that place before the aliens paid for what they had done."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="The reality of it was, these people had a choice. They could have kept running, they didn't have to stop here, didn't have to make a stand. But for whatever reason, I guess they had finally had enough. They knew what was coming and they stood and faced it down, right up until the end."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="As far as I could tell, someone had gotten trigger happy with a whole bunch of plasma grenades. Which side was responsible wasn't clear, but someone had torn this place up and it looked like everyone involved paid the price."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The police were in no position to fight a war, much less an alien invasion. Don't get me wrong, a lot of 'em tried, but most of them didn't live long enough to do any real damage. The situation here was a little different though-there were a lot of dead aliens piled up-more than usual anyway."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="When we got there, the police station was overrun with ADVENT troops, and they weren't taking any prisoners. Seeing what they had done to the station, knowing there had been people in there...if we were angry before, now we were motivated."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="After everything we had gone through, we needed a place to lay low for a while-some time to clear our heads. The map showed a farm outside of town, and that seemed as good a place as any to get some rest. In theory."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="No one was in the mood to stick around and loot the place, but we grabbed whatever we could on our way out."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Police Station was the last major landmark on the edge of town. Map aside, we knew people had flocked to police stations, army barracks, any place they thought might protect them from the aliens. A lot of people made their last stands in those places, and I wasn't looking forward to walking in on a massacre. Still, we had to know for sure."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="As we got closer, it was clear the aliens had already set up inside the station. Between ADVENT and the usual suspects, the entire place was crawling with hostiles. Whoever tried to hole up inside had definitely put up a fight...there were still fresh plasma burns smoldering when we got there."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="At least a fewof us made it through that place alive."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I was still in the game at this point, so somehow I got through there."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_CiviliansWipe AkEvent]
SpokenText="Despite how it sounds, we did actually find people alive in the Police Station, and with our help, some of them made it out of there."

[Play_Blast_PoliceStation_CiviliansSaved AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't know how they managed to survive, but I was pretty shocked to find some people still alive inside the station."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The first day went well, but now the aliens knew we were up to something."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]

[Play_Blast_GasStation_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]

SpokenText="Some of us made it out of there alive, but sacrifices were made."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_G AkEvent]
SpokenText="I can still remember the rush I got in that town, those first kills brought me back to life...made me believe again. While my new friends were focused on the hunt for buried treasure, I saw something else coming together. That was the first time I can remember feeling like humanity could still take back our world."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had to make do with whatever weapons we could scrounge up. We didn't know a whole lot about the alien tech back then. I figured if we actually found anything XCOM built, at least I could count on it being pointed at the aliens first."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_E_ALT AkEvent]
SpokenText="In the early days, the Faceless weren't even disguised half the time. And there were all kinds of silly ass rumors about shapeshifting animals, vehicles...all kinds of things that made trust even harder to come by among strangers."

SpokenText="In the early days, the Faceless weren't even disguised half the time. And there were all kinds of silly ass rumors about shapeshifting animals, vehicles...all kinds of things. That made trust even harder to come by among strangers."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's strange to think what it was like back then before ADVENT became the front...there were plenty of aliens, but a lot less barking. Stranger still is how quickly people forgot what the real faces of the war looked like...you wouldn't think the novelty of alien invaders would ever wear off."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had hoped we could scavenge a few supplies, maybe find something to eat at the diner. Unfortunately the aliens didn't give us a whole lot of time to look around."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I don't remember all the details, especially how I made it out of the base back then. I woke up in a smoking pile of rubble and crawled as far as I could. Beyond that, it was a lot of dark, bitter days in between."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I had been moving in the fringes, surviving on whatever I could, wherever I could. Truth be told, I had just about given up on everyone by then. Our so-called leaders had already told the world the fight was over, and I was in no position to convince anyone otherwise."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't know it yet, but our little skirmish near the gas station was just a taste of things to come. We were already thinking about deviating from the map to avoid trouble, but it wasn't gonna be that easy."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="Our first stop yielded a few decent upgrades, but nothing that was gonna set the world on fire. And there was only so much we could take with us. We had to travel light if we were going to keep up this pace."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Alright, people. Story time. This was almost 20 years ago, so my memory might be a little hazy. With XCOM gone and no sign of any survivors from HQ, I had somehow fallen in with a couple of other misfits the aliens hadn't managed to kill yet. We mostly kept our heads down and scavenged what we could. Until one day we found a map - a map claiming to point towards a human sanctuary, a gathering place for those of us still out there. We were suspicious of course, but we didn't really have much else to lose."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Five minutes in either direction and we would have never met, but for whatever reason my little group seemed to get along pretty well. We weren't much more than wandering vagabonds at that point, but the map gave us a purpose, something to work towards. That meant moving through occupied territory though, so this was sure to be a test of our resolve."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Hazy memory or not, I know we did better than that."

[Play_Blast_GasStation_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Well, obviously it didn't go like that...I'm still here, right?"

[Play_Blast_Farm_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens were throwing everything they had at us, but we made it off the farm without losing anyone."

[Play_Blast_Farm_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We made it clear of the farm despite the aliens' best efforts."

[Play_Blast_Farm_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things got a little ugly on the farm. I should have known better."

[Play_Blast_Farm_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Not everyone made it off the farm in one piece, but a few of us were still hanging on. We had to keep moving."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Even after 20 years we still haven't managed to get back enough of the world to start farming for ourselves again. I've wondered sometimes if that's all part of the Elders' master plan, get us reliant on their systems, then sit back and wait. The younger generations won't have any idea how to survive outside of the city centers."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="With the aliens coming for us directly now, I had my concerns about what we might find at the end of the road. We could have stopped, gone our separate ways-but I wasn't about to break up this thing we had going, whatever it was."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm still not entirely sure what the aliens did with the tens of millions of cattle and other animals we had across the country before they decided animal husbandry was too risky of a technology for humans to possess. I know it's got something to do with those damn ADVENT burgers."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="I remember hoping to avoid collateral damage at the time, but it was probably a good thing the farm was abandoned by the original owners. There wasn't a whole lot left of their barn after the fight."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The Andromedons were a surprise. We didn't know what to make of that diving suit they wear. Especially when it kept fighting even with that thing inside splayed out the front."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="Being on the farm brought back a lot of memories. It would have been nice to find a quiet spot to rest for a bit, but we had kicked the hornet's nest, and they weren't about to let us sit around and reminisce about the old days."

[Play_Blast_Farm_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="It wasn't until we finally stopped to catch our breath that I realized what that symbol was we kept seeing, the graffiti. It was right there on the map all along... the dam. That's where the alien reinforcements were coming from. That's what the survivors had been trying to tell us all along."

[Play_Blast_Farm_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We found some odd weapons on the farm, not the kind of thing you would normally find on ADVENT... or anyone else for that matter."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things started to open up as we got away from town. We made a beeline straight for the farm in the hopes of getting a few hours rest. We knew at this point the aliens were going to come looking for us eventually. We had left a path of destruction that only pointed one direction. I just hoped we'd catch a breather before the next round of reinforcements showed up."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="We rolled in to a nice homestead, big red barn and all that, kinda reminded me of the old family farm back in Kansas. But that's another story...and unfortunately this one leads us right back into another big fight. In retrospect we probably should have avoided any landmarks, but we were all worn out and not exactly thinking straight."

[Play_Blast_Farm_GraffitiSighted AkEvent]
SpokenText="On one of the walls of the barn, we found that same graffiti from the freight yard...a circle above a square. It still hadn't dawned on us yet, but the answer was right in front of us the whole time."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We're almost to the end. Don't give up hope now."

[Play_Blast_Farm_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="The farm would have been a fine place to check out, but that's not how the story goes."

[Play_Blast_Dam_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens threw just about everything they had at us, but we pulled it off."

[Play_Blast_Dam_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had done it...we made it through the gauntlet alive. We were feeling pretty good about ourselves, nothing quite like seeing your enemies driven off before you."

[Play_Blast_Dam_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We all fought hard to the very end, but it wasn't easy. We took some shots in the process."

[Play_Blast_Dam_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't all make it in the end, but those who gave up their lives went out with pride, heads held high."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="Eventually it dawned on me, once we got through this fight, we'd have to figure out what to do next. Somehow in the heat of battle, I panicked for a second thinking ahead to the possibility of losing my new friends. We'd just have to find someone else to pick a fight with."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="By now my squad was probably the most dangerous group of alien killers on the continent-except maybe for the Reapers, but I hadn't met Volk just yet."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't consider it at first, but fighting on top of that dam was probably a bad idea. Tight quarters, plenty of things that could explode in our face, and the toughest aliens we had encountered so far on this little expedition."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="As much time as I've spent trying to forget those days, you have to expect some of the finer details to get a little blurry. Thinking about it now... I'm pretty sure what we ran into back then was some kind of Avatar. I remember the hair...just take my word for it."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had picked up a few upgrades along the way, but the aliens weren't about to give us any kind of technological advantage-they wanted to finish us-and they brought the guns to make it happen."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="At one time the dam had provided steady power for the town and the whole county beyond. From what we could tell, the aliens had seized it to power some kind of portal..."

[Play_Blast_Dam_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="So that's the story, at least what I remember of it. Good stuff, right? Maybe if you're lucky, I'll think of a few more. I know Shen definitely has a few tall-tales of her own."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens must have been using the dam as some kind of rally point or rendezvous, because this was no patrol, no routine ADVENT sweep. They had brought out something special just for us, and to be honest, it was...serious. If I had had any sense of self-preservation back then, I might have been worried about losing this one. I put on a brave face for the others. This wasn't the time to get shook up."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="The aliens were guarding the place like it was hallowed ground. With no survivors and nothing to salvage, we came here looking for a fight, and that's all we found. Among the squad we all agreed, to hell with the aliens-if the dam was important to them, then we were going to take it away, permanently."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="This was an inciting moment in our history. Let's see if we can do a little better than that."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I wouldn't be here to tell the story if I hadn't managed to cross that dam."

[Play_Blast_Dam_Ending AkEvent]
SpokenText="This group, these people...they were the real beginning of the resistance. Word of our attack on the dam that day spread far and wide. The stories have varied from town to town, but the details didn't matter. It gave people hope, and after that day, some of them chose to start fighting back."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="The cemetery was rough, but my new recruits pulled together pretty well."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="As grim as it seemed, we made it out of the cemetery not much worse for wear."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'll never forget the ones that helped me get to this point. I wouldn't be here without their sacrifice."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We took a few casualties, but it could have been a lot worse. I was just happy to keep moving."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="I got to thinking about all the people I know for sure didn't make it out of HQ. Assuming the aliens haven't tried to clear it out, that mountain is the final resting place for a lot of good people. I had always hoped to go back there one day and put up a marker, or something at least."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had spent a fair amount of time together, but my new friends didn't know much about my background. To them, I was just an ex-military survivor, another broken down veteran. As time went on, I think they started to piece it together on their own, and I didn't mind keeping them guessing."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="I hadn't felt a sense of comradery in a long time. Most people were respectful of the surviving war veterans that were still out here. Some might even offer us a friendly smile. Still, I ran into plenty of people who couldn't do anything but blame us. Soldiers, politicians, doctors...we had all failed someone in one way or another."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="I'm not sure I ever really believed in the prospect of finding survivors, and the weapons my team were after weren't going to do much on their own. Notice how I said team? That's when I started to realize what the actual payoff here was."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I had seen a few zombies during the early days of the invasion, but not like this, not up close. They were human once...but we didn't have any choice. The last place you want to run into a bunch of psychic aliens is a cemetery full of fresh graves."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="In the two years or so since we lost the base, I hadn't heard so much as a peep about XCOM, much less run into any familiar faces. Most people never knew we existed in the first place, so there wasn't a whole lot of point in asking around."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="So, the Cemetery didn't end up being the quiet shortcut we had hoped for, but we were still headed in the right direction-assuming this sanctuary even existed in the first place."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had gotten used to salvaging gear by that point. We'd picked through just about everything left on the alien bodies."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="We had no idea who made the map in the first place, but if there really was some kind of hidden sanctuary out there, I wanted to see it for myself. The map was steering us right through town, but we figured maybe we'd creep through the cemetery instead to keep things quiet.  I tried to take a few notes just in case we forged a new path-if history was gonna to be written by the victors, then I at least wanted to have something ready just in case we finally got our act together."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were all a little suspicious, but we managed to pick up another recruit near the cemetery. As risky as it was, we needed all the help we could get, and I wasn't worried about splitting the gear another way. Once we got close, the aliens were all over us pretty quick. What we found was...difficult to face."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I think I did a little better than that back then."

[Play_Blast_Cemetery_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="I wouldn't be sitting here today if that's how things played out."

[Play_Blast_Bar_TotalVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="I didn't get the drink I was after, but we also made it through alive, so I wasn't exactly complaining."

[Play_Blast_Bar_TotalVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We left the bar sober, but fully intact. I couldn't really complain about the outcome."

[Play_Blast_Bar_PartialVictory_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="It's never easy seeing your friends go down in combat, even after everything I had been through over the years."

[Play_Blast_Bar_PartialVictory_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="It was a tough fight, but we managed to get out with only a few casualties."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_F AkEvent]
SpokenText="By now we had definitely gotten someone's attention. The aliens were down a couple of dozen kills, and we were taking our sweet time clearing out every last one of 'em. For people that came out here as scavengers, my new pals had almost forgotten about looking for gear."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_E AkEvent]
SpokenText="We didn't have the slightest clue what these ADVENT goons were barking about back then. Not that it mattered. The more of 'em we took out, the more I started to see that with the right people, there was still a chance we could make a difference out here."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_D AkEvent]
SpokenText="ADVENT was still in the early stages of establishing itself as the new global front, but we ran into some of their first troops that day outside the bar. I was pretty confident we'd come out on top, but even I was impressed by how well we handled these guys."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_C AkEvent]
SpokenText="Finding a drink wasn't easy, but the good stuff was still floating around out there in the territories-all highly illegal of course. If you couldn't trade for it, you could always try your luck in the abandoned cities. A lot of people disappeared chasing vices of the old world back then."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="There were still some independent businesses out there trying to survive the occupation back then. In a few areas, things almost seemed normal, but ADVENT wasn't having it. Constantly changing restrictions on \"unauthorized\" food sources made it almost impossible not to move to the new city centers."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Musings_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="By now we were starting to work pretty well together, and my little team had already racked up a respectable kill-count by the time we moved in on the bar. That was the only explanation I could come up with, 'cause it didn't take long for a whole lot of aliens to close on our position."

[Play_Blast_Bar_MissionSummary AkEvent]
SpokenText="At this point I was starting to wonder whether the map was guiding us to the aliens, or the aliens were just keyed in on the path we were trying to take. Either way, I couldn't imagine any refugees getting past what we had just dealt with."

[Play_Blast_Bar_LootSelect AkEvent]
SpokenText="We were able to pull some useable armor vests and PCS components from the ADVENT units near the Bar, but there was no sign of anything I recognized from XCOM."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Loading AkEvent]
SpokenText="The map was driving us towards what looked to be some kind of freight yard, but first we had to cut across the edge of town near a local dive bar. I remember being genuinely excited at the prospect of finding a nice stiff drink. Unfortunately, the arrival of ADVENT had ushered in a new era of restrictions and bans, which meant pretty much anything that you might consider fun was outlawed... Still, there was a chance I might find something good out there in the boonies."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Intro AkEvent]
SpokenText="Things were quiet when we showed up, but it looked we had just missed the action- with all the hallmarks of an ADVENT sweep gone south. In those days, they were rounding up stragglers pretty aggressively, and it didn't take much to provoke a fight. We never did find out who it was, but odds are they were either convinced to move to a city center, or dumped in a mass grave somewhere."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Failure_B AkEvent]
SpokenText="Alright, let's start at the beginning. We were approaching the bar..."

[Play_Blast_Bar_Failure_A AkEvent]
SpokenText="We know for sure at least I escaped, right?"

[Play_Blast_Bar_CiviliansWipe AkEvent]
SpokenText="No, that's not how it went. We definitely saved some of those people before the aliens got to 'em."

[Play_Blast_Bar_CiviliansSaved AkEvent]
SpokenText="I remember we did manage to rescue at least a couple of civilians before things got ugly."
