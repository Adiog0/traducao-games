SpokenText="We're moving on what looks to be the remains of an ADVENT facility of some kind.  Preliminary scans show the area to be lifeless but we're not gonna take any chances. You'll attempt access from one of the upper levels to avoid detection.  No one knows these systems better then Shen, which is why she'll take point.  Gain entry to the facility, determine the source of that transmission and if it's hostile...take it down. "

SpokenText="Commander, I'm too old to start believing in ghosts which means someone had to access that unit remotely.  If they can access Rover, there's no telling what else they might be able to do. I strongly suggest we make investigating that signal our top priority. "
